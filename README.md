# APS360-Project
APS360 Final Project: Creating a Geometry Dash Bot with ML

Summer of 2024

We intend to create a bot that can play Geometry Dash.
We will use both an RL and a CNN model to do so. Both
models will be trained separately. The RL model will use
the CNN model to identify the objects in its path and make
a decision.

The Documents tab contains all of our project submissions
as latex files and their respective pdfs.
